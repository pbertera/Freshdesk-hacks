# Prevent lost reply

A subtle issue with Freshdesk happens when you start replying to a ticket and before sending the reply you change the status of the ticket: if you change the status to closed or resolved your browser is automatically sent to the ticket list page and your reply isn't sent to the customer.


So the customer receives the ticket resolution notification without receiving any reply, you can imagine the customer happines.

This Freshplug allows you to change the ticket propertis but doesn't allow to sumit the "update" form is a Draft message is open: you will be forced to send or remove the Draft before applying the changes.
